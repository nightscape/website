# June 2020 Release

Hello everyone! We hope you are having a great summer! We are releasing a couple of new (highly requested) features in Gitpod for everyone.

* BitBucket support!
* Search for Extensions in Gitpod

## BitBucket Support

Now BitBucket developers will be able to have ready-to-code development enviornments! ðŸŽ‰ To configure OAuth access to BitBucket please see [the OAuth access control panel](https://gitpod.io/access-control/). 

## Search for Extensions in Gitpod

Before searching for extensions was not ideal you had to search through some extternal registry and download the extension and drag and drop it into Gitpod but now you'll be able to search and install your favoraite Gitpod extension *from gitpod!*
